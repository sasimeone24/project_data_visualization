## Project Description
The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data. In my case, I used a Kaggle soccer data, which I studied and analyzed to obtain graphs of heat maps, bars and lollipop.

## Instructions
- Select a dataset from a public source.
- Create a Jupyter notebook to analyze the data
- Using your data, create a visualizations. Explain what insight or information is inferred from these visualizations. The explanation should be in the notebook in markdown cells.

## Workflow
- The first step was to find a dataset.
- The second step consisted of understanding the data and making sure if it had to be cleaned or not.
- A search was made of the statistical analyzes used in soccer in order to understand some of the columns of the dataset.
- I asked questions that later I had to answer from the data and the visualization.
- The graphs that answered the questions posed were made.
- The notebook was ordered. Comments were placed on the lines of code and the presentation was made.

## Organization
In the repository we have the visualization_soccer_data file, which is the python file that allows us to manage the data of the files and to be able to make the required visualizations. On the other hand we have the data folder where the csv of the data are. In addition, the picture folder is where the images of the graphs obtained are found
